## How to Add Images

### Option 1: Use Unsplash (Recommended for Banner)
1. Visit https://unsplash.com
2. Search for relevant education/technology images
3. Download the image (free license, attribution appreciated)
4. Resize to recommended dimensions
5. Save in this directory

### Option 2: Capture App Screenshots
1. Build and run the CampusVault app on an emulator or device
2. Navigate to each screen
3. Take screenshots (recommended resolution: 1080x2400)
4. Crop and resize as needed
5. Save in this directory with appropriate filename

### Option 3: Use Mockup Tools

## Temporary Solution
Until real screenshots are added, you can:
1. Use generic education images from Unsplash
2. Create simple mockups showing the app concept
3. Use placeholder services like:
   - https://placeholder.com
   - https://via.placeholder.com
   
Example placeholder URLs:
- Banner: https://via.placeholder.com/1200x400/4A90E2/FFFFFF?text=CampusVault
- Screenshots: https://via.placeholder.com/400x800/E8F5E9/2E7D32?text=Home+Screen
