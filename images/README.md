# CampusVault Images

This directory contains information about images used in the CampusVault README.

## Current Implementation

The README now uses **direct Unsplash image URLs** for all visuals, eliminating the need for local image files. This approach:
- ✅ Reduces repository size
- ✅ Always serves high-quality images
- ✅ No manual image downloads needed
- ✅ Images are automatically optimized by Unsplash CDN

## Image Sources

All images are sourced from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com) - a free, high-quality stock photo platform.

### Screenshot Placeholders

## Replacing with Real Screenshots

When you're ready to add actual app screenshots:

### Option 1: Keep Using Unsplash (Current)
The current setup works well for demonstration. No action needed!

### Option 2: Replace with Real App Screenshots

1. **Capture Screenshots**
   - Run the app on device/emulator
   - Navigate to each screen
   - Take screenshots (1080x2400 recommended)

2. **Upload to Image Hosting**
   - Upload to Imgur, GitHub Issues, or similar
   - Or commit to this repository

3. **Update README.md**
   - Replace Unsplash URLs with your screenshot URLs
   - Example:
   ```markdown
   <img src="YOUR_IMAGE_URL" width="250px" alt="Home Screen"/>
   ```
