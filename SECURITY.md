# Security Policy

## Supported Releases

We support only the latest stable and release candidate (RC) versions. Older versions may not receive security updates. Please use the most recent release for the best security.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it by opening a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/AstronDaniel/CampusVault/issues) or contacting the maintainers directly. Do **not** disclose security issues publicly until they have been reviewed and addressed.

## Security Best Practices

- Always use the latest working release or RC version.
- Keep dependencies and tools up to date.
- Never commit secrets, credentials, or sensitive data to the repository.
- Use environment variables for all sensitive configuration.
- Review and audit third-party packages before use.
- Follow the principle of least privilege for all access and permissions.

## Responsible Disclosure

We appreciate responsible disclosure. Please allow us a reasonable time to investigate and address the issue before any public disclosure.

## Contact

For urgent security issues, contact the maintainers via email (see repository profile) or through GitHub issues.

Thank you for helping keep CampusVault and its users secure!
